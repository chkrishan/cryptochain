** Transaction Pool :- it is a data structure which collect the transactions which is created by wallet
throughout the network .
-> the inner implemenatation can be anything you like , like arrays and map with key value structure 

it could be anything as long as it supports three main behaviour
1. it collects unique set of transaction objects
2. it could update already stored transactions when a change has been submitted by a wallet
3. it can rewrite multiple transactions in the inner collection

***************-----------------------********************

### every node in the network is gonna have their own instance of transaction pool
but the key is making sure that all the transaction pool are synchronised
when one node creates a new transaction and updates a existing one then 
that transaction have to be broadcast on the network 
based on the transaction id it will be add to every transaction pool if its new

** TRANSACTION MINOR ** :- the job of the miner is to mine new blocks(or add new blocks to blockchain) whose data consist set of transaction .

-> transaction miner gets the transaction from the transaction pool

-> they are the indivisuals who pays the cost of computational power and do the work 
to find the valid hash of new block

-> by mining a new block of adding the new block to the blockchain miners get the block reward(mining reward)

$$$$ functionality achieve in order to properly mine a block $$$$$

1. grab all the valid transaction in the pool
2. generate a miner's reward
3. do the cpu work to find the valid hash
4. broasdcast and update the blockchain
5. clear the transaction pool (of its own node not all the pools)

## in order to make sure all the pools are cleared when a new transaction is mine 
each blockchain instance is going to be resposible of clearing its transaction pool for any new transaction 
that gets included in the overall blockchain. this is all in the effort to 
prevent the submission of transactions that have already been included in the chain
