### every node in the network is gonna have their own instance of transaction pool
but the key is making sure that all the transaction pool are synchronised
when one node creates a new transaction and updates a existing one then 
that transaction have to be broadcast on the network 
based on the transaction id it will be add to every transaction pool if its new
